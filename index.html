        <pre class="notes-body">### Changes

- Agents/Anthropic: add opt-in 1M context beta header support for Opus/Sonnet via model `params.context1m: true` (maps to `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07`).
- Agents/Models: support Anthropic Sonnet 4.6 (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`) across aliases/defaults with forward-compat fallback when upstream catalogs still only expose Sonnet 4.5.
- Commands/Subagents: add `/subagents spawn` for deterministic subagent activation from chat commands. (#18218) Thanks @JoshuaLelon.
- Agents/Subagents: add an accepted response note for `sessions_spawn` explaining polling subagents are disabled for one-off calls. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents: prefix spawned subagent task messages with context to preserve source information in downstream handling. Thanks @tyler6204.
- iOS/Share: add an iOS share extension that forwards shared URL/text/image content directly to gateway `agent.request`, with delivery-route fallback and optional receipt acknowledgements. (#19424) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Talk: add a `Background Listening` toggle that keeps Talk Mode active while the app is backgrounded (off by default for battery safety). Thanks @zeulewan.
- iOS/Talk: add a `Voice Directive Hint` toggle for Talk Mode prompts so users can disable ElevenLabs voice-switching instructions to save tokens when not needed. (#18250) Thanks @zeulewan.
- iOS/Talk: harden barge-in behavior by disabling interrupt-on-speech when output route is built-in speaker/receiver, reducing false interruptions from local TTS bleed-through. Thanks @zeulewan.
- Slack: add native single-message text streaming with Slack `chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream`; keep reply threading aligned with `replyToMode`, default streaming to enabled, and fall back to normal delivery when streaming fails. (#9972) Thanks @natedenh.
- Slack: add configurable streaming modes for draft previews. (#18555) Thanks @Solvely-Colin.
- Telegram/Agents: add inline button `style` support (`primary|success|danger`) across message tool schema, Telegram action parsing, send pipeline, and runtime prompt guidance. (#18241) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: surface user message reactions as system events, with configurable `channels.telegram.reactionNotifications` scope. (#10075) Thanks @Glucksberg.
- iMessage: support `replyToId` on outbound text/media sends and normalize leading `[[reply_to:<id>]]` tags so replies target the intended iMessage. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Tool Display/Web UI: add intent-first tool detail views and exec summaries. (#18592) Thanks @xdLawless2.
- Discord: expose native `/exec` command options (host/security/ask/node) so Discord slash commands get autocomplete and structured inputs. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: allow reusable interactive components with `components.reusable=true` so buttons, selects, and forms can be used multiple times before expiring. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Discord: add per-button `allowedUsers` allowlist for interactive components to restrict who can click buttons. Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Cron/Gateway: separate per-job webhook delivery (`delivery.mode = "webhook"`) from announce delivery, enforce valid HTTP(S) webhook URLs, and keep a temporary legacy `notify + cron.webhook` fallback for stored jobs. (#17901) Thanks @advaitpaliwal.
- Cron/CLI: add deterministic default stagger for recurring top-of-hour cron schedules (including 6-field seconds cron), auto-migrate existing jobs to persisted `schedule.staggerMs`, and add `openclaw cron add/edit --stagger <duration>` plus `--exact` overrides for per-job timing control.
- Cron: log per-run model/provider usage telemetry in cron run logs/webhooks and add a local usage report script for aggregating token usage by job. (#18172) Thanks @HankAndTheCrew.
- Tools/Web: add URL allowlists for `web_search` and `web_fetch`. (#18584) Thanks @smartprogrammer93.
- Browser: add `extraArgs` config for custom Chrome launch arguments. (#18443) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Voice Call: pre-cache inbound greeting TTS for faster first playback. (#18447) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Skills: compact skill file `<location>` paths in the system prompt by replacing home-directory prefixes with `~`, and add targeted compaction tests for prompt serialization behavior. (#14776) Thanks @bitfish3.
- Skills: refine skill-description routing boundaries with explicit "Use when"/"NOT for" guidance for coding-agent/github/weather, and clarify PTY/browser fallback wording. (#14577) Thanks @DylanWoodAkers.
- Auto-reply/Prompts: include trusted inbound `message_id` in conversation metadata payloads for downstream targeting workflows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Auto-reply: include `sender_id` in trusted inbound metadata so moderation workflows can target the sender without relying on untrusted text. (#18303) Thanks @crimeacs.
- UI/Sessions: avoid duplicating typed session prefixes in display names (for example `Subagent Subagent ...`). Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Z.AI: enable `tool_stream` by default for real-time tool call streaming, with opt-out via `params.tool_stream: false`. (#18173) Thanks @tianxiao1430-jpg.
- Plugins: add `before_agent_start` model/provider overrides before resolution. (#18568) Thanks @natefikru.
- Mattermost: add emoji reaction actions plus reaction event notifications, including an explicit boolean `remove` flag to avoid accidental removals. (#18608) Thanks @echo931.
- Memory/Search: add FTS fallback plus query expansion for memory search. (#18304) Thanks @irchelper.

### Fixes

- Agents/Image: collapse resize diagnostics to one line per image and include visible pixel/byte size details in the log message for faster triage.
- Agents/Subagents: preemptively guard accumulated tool-result context before model calls by truncating oversized outputs and compacting oldest tool-result messages to avoid context-window overflow crashes. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Subagents: add explicit subagent guidance to recover from `[compacted: tool output removed to free context]` / `[truncated: output exceeded context limit]` markers by re-reading with smaller chunks instead of full-file `cat`. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: make `read` auto-page across chunks (when no explicit `limit` is provided) and scale its per-call output budget from model `contextWindow`, so larger contexts can read more before context guards kick in. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Agents/Tools: strip duplicated `read` truncation payloads from tool-result `details` and make pre-call context guarding account for heavy tool-result metadata, so repeated `read` calls no longer bypass compaction and overflow model context windows. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Reply threading: keep reply context sticky across streamed/split chunks and preserve `replyToId` on all chunk sends across shared and channel-specific delivery paths (including iMessage, BlueBubbles, Telegram, Discord, and Matrix), so follow-up bubbles stay attached to the same referenced message. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Gateway/Agent: defer transient lifecycle `error` snapshots with a short grace window so `agent.wait` does not resolve early during retry/failover. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Hooks/Automation: bridge outbound/inbound message lifecycle into internal hook events (`message:received`, `message:sent`) with session-key correlation guards, while keeping per-payload success/error reporting accurate for chunked and best-effort deliveries. (PR #9387)
- Media understanding: honor `agents.defaults.imageModel` during auto-discovery so implicit image analysis uses configured primary/fallback image models. (PR #7607)
- iOS/Onboarding: stop auth Step 3 retry-loop churn by pausing reconnect attempts on unauthorized/missing-token gateway errors and keeping auth/pairing issue state sticky during manual retry. (#19153) Thanks @mbelinky.
- Voice-call: auto-end calls when media streams disconnect to prevent stuck active calls. (#18435) Thanks @JayMishra-source.
- Voice call/Gateway: prevent overlapping closed-loop turn races with per-call turn locking, route transcript dedupe via source-aware fingerprints with strict cache eviction bounds, and harden `voicecall latency` stats for large logs without spread-operator stack overflow. (#19140) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Chat: route ChatSheet RPCs through the operator session instead of the node session to avoid node-role authorization failures for `chat.history`, `chat.send`, and `sessions.list`. (#19320) Thanks @mbelinky.
- macOS/Update: correct the Sparkle appcast version for 2026.2.15 so updates are offered again. (#18201)
- Gateway/Auth: clear stale device-auth tokens after device token mismatch errors so re-paired clients can re-auth. (#18201)
- Telegram: enable DM voice-note transcription with CLI fallback handling. (#18564) Thanks @thhuang.
- Telegram/Polls: restore Telegram poll action wiring in channel handlers. (#18122) Thanks @akyourowngames.
- WebChat: strip reply/audio directive tags from rendered chat output. (#18093) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Discord: honor configured HTTP proxy for app-id and allowlist REST resolution. (#17958) Thanks @k2009.
- BlueBubbles: add fallback path to recover outbound `message_id` from `fromMe` webhooks when platform message IDs are missing. Thanks @tyler6204.
- BlueBubbles: match outbound message-id fallback recovery by chat identifier as well as account context. Thanks @tyler6204.
- BlueBubbles: include sender identifier in untrusted conversation metadata for conversation info payloads. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Security/Exec: fix the OC-09 credential-theft path via environment-variable injection. (#18048) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Security/Config: confine `$include` resolution to the top-level config directory, harden traversal/symlink checks with cross-platform-safe path containment, and add doctor hints for invalid escaped include paths. (#18652) Thanks @aether-ai-agent.
- Providers: improve error messaging for unconfigured local `ollama`/`vllm` providers. (#18183) Thanks @arosstale.
- TTS: surface all provider errors instead of only the last error in aggregated failures. (#17964) Thanks @ikari-pl.
- CLI/Doctor/Configure: skip gateway auth checks for loopback-only setups. (#18407) Thanks @sggolakiya.
- CLI/Doctor: reconcile gateway service-token drift after re-pair flows. (#18525) Thanks @norunners.
- Process/Windows: disable detached spawn in exec runs to prevent empty command output. (#18067) Thanks @arosstale.
- Process: gracefully terminate process trees with SIGTERM before SIGKILL. (#18626) Thanks @sauerdaniel.
- Sessions/Windows: use atomic session-store writes to prevent context loss on Windows. (#18347) Thanks @twcwinston.
- Agents/Image: validate base64 image payloads before provider submission. (#18263) Thanks @sriram369.
- Models CLI: validate catalog entries in `openclaw models set`. (#18129) Thanks @carrotRakko.
- Usage: isolate last-turn totals in token usage reporting to avoid mixed-turn totals. (#18052) Thanks @arosstale.
- Cron: resolve `accountId` from agent bindings in isolated sessions. (#17996) Thanks @simonemacario.
- Gateway/HTTP: preserve unbracketed IPv6 `Host` headers when normalizing requests. (#18061) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Sandbox: fix workspace-directory orphaning during SHA-1 -> SHA-256 slug migration. (#18523) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Ollama/Qwen: handle Qwen 3 reasoning field format in Ollama responses. (#18631) Thanks @mr-sk.
- OpenAI/Transcripts: always drop orphaned reasoning blocks from transcript repair. (#18632) Thanks @TySabs.
- Fix types in all tests. Typecheck the whole repository.
- Gateway/Channels: wire `gateway.channelHealthCheckMinutes` into strict config validation, treat implicit account status as managed for health checks, and harden channel auto-restart flow (preserve restart-attempt caps across crash loops, propagate enabled/configured runtime flags, and stop pending restart backoff after manual stop). Thanks @steipete.
- Gateway/WebChat: hard-cap `chat.history` oversized payloads by truncating high-cost fields and replacing over-budget entries with placeholders, so history fetches stay within configured byte limits and avoid chat UI freezes. (#18505)
- UI/Usage: replace lingering undefined `var(--text-muted)` usage with `var(--muted)` in usage date-range and chart styles to keep muted text visible across themes. (#17975) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Usage: preserve selected-range totals when timeline data is downsampled by bucket-aggregating timeseries points (instead of dropping intermediate points), so filtered tokens/cost stay accurate. (#17959) Thanks @jogelin.
- UI/Sessions: refresh the sessions table only after successful deletes and preserve delete errors on cancel/failure paths, so deleted sessions disappear automatically without masking delete failures. (#18507)
- Scripts/UI/Windows: fix `pnpm ui:*` spawn `EINVAL` failures by restoring shell-backed launch for `.cmd`/`.bat` runners, narrowing shell usage to launcher types that require it, and rejecting unsafe forwarded shell metacharacters in UI script args. (#18594)
- Hooks/Session-memory: recover `/new` conversation summaries when session pointers are reset-path or missing `sessionFile`, and consistently prefer the newest `.jsonl.reset.*` transcript candidate for fallback extraction. (#18088)
- Auto-reply/Sessions: prevent stale thread ID leakage into non-thread sessions so replies stay in the main DM after topic interactions. (#18528) Thanks @j2h4u.
- Slack: restrict forwarded-attachment ingestion to explicit shared-message attachments and skip non-Slack forwarded `image_url` fetches, preventing non-forward attachment unfurls from polluting inbound agent context while preserving forwarded message handling.
- Feishu: detect bot mentions in post messages with embedded docs when `message.mentions` is empty. (#18074) Thanks @popomore.
- Agents/Sessions: align session lock watchdog hold windows with run and compaction timeout budgets (plus grace), preventing valid long-running turns from being force-unlocked mid-run while still recovering hung lock owners. (#18060)
- Cron: preserve default model fallbacks for cron agent runs when only `model.primary` is overridden, so failover still follows configured fallbacks unless explicitly cleared with `fallbacks: []`. (#18210) Thanks @mahsumaktas.
- Cron: route text-only announce output through the main session announce flow via runSubagentAnnounceFlow so cron text-only output remains visible to the initiating session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron: treat `timeoutSeconds: 0` as no-timeout (not clamped to 1), ensuring long-running cron runs are not prematurely terminated. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron announce injection now targets the session determined by delivery config (`to` + channel) instead of defaulting to the current session. Thanks @tyler6204.
- Cron/Heartbeat: canonicalize session-scoped reminder `sessionKey` routing and preserve explicit flat `sessionKey` cron tool inputs, preventing enqueue/wake namespace drift for session-targeted reminders. (#18637) Thanks @vignesh07.
- Cron/Webhooks: reuse existing session IDs for webhook/cron runs when the session key is stable and still fresh, preserving conversation history. (#18031) Thanks @Operative-001.
- Cron: prevent spin loops when cron jobs complete within the scheduled second by advancing the next run and enforcing a minimum refire gap. (#18073) Thanks @widingmarcus-cyber.
- OpenClawKit/iOS ChatUI: accept canonical session-key completion events for local pending runs and preserve message IDs across history refreshes, preventing stuck "thinking" state and message flicker after gateway replies. (#18165) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Onboarding: add QR-first onboarding wizard with setup-code deep link support, pairing/auth issue guidance, and device-pair QR generation improvements for Telegram/Web/TUI fallback flows. (#18162) Thanks @mbelinky and @Marvae.
- iOS/Gateway: stabilize connect/discovery state handling, add onboarding reset recovery in Settings, and fix iOS gateway-controller coverage for command-surface and last-connection persistence behavior. (#18164) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Talk: harden mobile talk config handling by ignoring redacted/env-placeholder API keys, support secure local keychain override, improve accessibility motion/contrast behavior in status UI, and tighten ATS to local-network allowance. (#18163) Thanks @mbelinky.
- iOS/Location: restore the significant location monitor implementation (service hooks + protocol surface + ATS key alignment) after merge drift so iOS builds compile again. (#18260) Thanks @ngutman.
- iOS/Signing: auto-select local Apple Development team during iOS project generation/build, prefer the canonical OpenClaw team when available, and support local per-machine signing overrides without committing team IDs. (#18421) Thanks @ngutman.
- Discord/Telegram: make per-account message action gates effective for both action listing and execution, and preserve top-level gate restrictions when account overrides only specify a subset of `actions` keys (account key -> base key -> default fallback). (#18494)
- Telegram: keep DM-topic replies and draft previews in the originating private-chat topic by preserving positive `message_thread_id` values for DM threads. (#18586) Thanks @sebslight.
- Telegram: preserve private-chat topic `message_thread_id` on outbound sends (message/sticker/poll), keep thread-not-found retry fallback, and avoid masking `chat not found` routing errors. (#18993) Thanks @obviyus.
- Discord: prevent duplicate media delivery when the model uses the `message send` tool with media, by skipping media extraction from messaging tool results since the tool already sent the message directly. (#18270)
- Discord: route `audioAsVoice` auto-replies through the voice message API so opt-in audio renders as voice messages. (#18041) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Discord: skip auto-thread creation in forum/media/voice/stage channels and keep group session last-route metadata fresh to avoid invalid thread API errors and lost follow-up sends. (#18098) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Discord/Commands: normalize `commands.allowFrom` entries with `user:`/`discord:`/`pk:` prefixes and `<@id>` mentions so command authorization matches Discord allowlist behavior. (#18042)
- Telegram: keep draft-stream preview replies attached to the user message for `replyToMode: "all"` in groups and DMs, preserving threaded reply context from preview through finalization. (#17880) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: prevent streaming final replies from being overwritten by later final/error payloads, and suppress fallback tool-error warnings when a recovered assistant answer already exists after tool calls. (#17883) Thanks @Marvae and @obviyus.
- Telegram: debounce the first draft-stream preview update (30-char threshold) and finalize short responses by editing the stop-time preview message, improving first push notifications and avoiding duplicate final sends. (#18148) Thanks @Marvae.
- Telegram: disable block streaming when `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `off`, preventing newline/content-block replies from splitting into multiple messages. (#17679) Thanks @saivarunk.
- Telegram: keep `streamMode: "partial"` draft previews in a single message across assistant-message/reasoning boundaries, preventing duplicate preview bubbles during partial-mode tool-call turns. (#18956) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: normalize native command names for Telegram menu registration (`-` -> `_`) to avoid `BOT_COMMAND_INVALID` command-menu wipeouts, and log failed command syncs instead of silently swallowing them. (#19257) Thanks @akramcodez.
- Telegram: route non-abort slash commands on the normal chat/topic sequential lane while keeping true abort requests (`/stop`, `stop`) on the control lane, preventing command/reply race conditions from control-lane bypass. (#17899) Thanks @obviyus.
- Telegram: ignore `<media:...>` placeholder lines when extracting `MEDIA:` tool-result paths, preventing false local-file reads and dropped replies. (#18510) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- Telegram: skip retries when inbound media `getFile` fails with Telegram's 20MB limit and continue processing message text, avoiding dropped messages for oversized attachments. (#18531) Thanks @brandonwise.
- Telegram: clear stored polling offsets when bot tokens change or accounts are deleted, preventing stale offsets after token rotations. (#18233)
- Telegram: enable `autoSelectFamily` by default on Node.js 22+ so IPv4 fallback works on broken IPv6 networks. (#18272) Thanks @nacho9900.
- Auto-reply/TTS: keep tool-result media delivery enabled in group chats and native command sessions (while still suppressing tool summary text) so `NO_REPLY` follow-ups do not drop successful TTS audio. (#17991) Thanks @zerone0x.
- Agents/Tools: deliver tool-result media even when verbose tool output is off so media attachments are not dropped. (#16679)
- Discord: optimize reaction notification handling to skip unnecessary message fetches in `off`/`all`/`allowlist` modes, streamline reaction routing, and improve reaction emoji formatting. (#18248) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow and @victorGPT.
- CLI/Pairing: make `openclaw qr --remote` prefer `gateway.remote.url` over tailscale/public URL resolution and register the `openclaw clawbot qr` legacy alias path. (#18091)
- CLI/QR: restore fail-fast validation for `openclaw qr --remote` when neither `gateway.remote.url` nor tailscale `serve`/`funnel` is configured, preventing unusable remote pairing QR flows. (#18166) Thanks @mbelinky.
- CLI: fix parent/subcommand option collisions across gateway, daemon, update, ACP, and browser command flows, while preserving legacy `browser set headers --json <payload>` compatibility.
- CLI/Doctor: ensure `openclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive --yes` exits promptly after completion so one-shot automation no longer hangs. (#18502)
- CLI/Doctor: auto-repair `dmPolicy="open"` configs missing wildcard allowlists and write channel-correct repair paths (including `channels.googlechat.dm.allowFrom`) so `openclaw doctor --fix` no longer leaves Google Chat configs invalid after attempted repair. (#18544)
- CLI/Doctor: detect gateway service token drift when the gateway token is only provided via environment variables, keeping service repairs aligned after token rotation.
- Gateway/Update: prevent restart crash loops after failed self-updates by restarting only on successful updates, stopping early on failed install/build steps, and running `openclaw doctor --fix` during updates to sanitize config. (#18131) Thanks @RamiNoodle733.
- Gateway/Update: preserve update.run restart delivery context so post-update status replies route back to the initiating channel/thread. (#18267) Thanks @yinghaosang.
- CLI/Update: run a standalone restart helper after updates, honoring service-name overrides and reporting restart initiation separately from confirmed restarts. (#18050)
- CLI/Daemon: warn when a gateway restart sees a stale service token so users can reinstall with `openclaw gateway install --force`, and skip drift warnings for non-gateway service restarts. (#18018)
- CLI/Daemon: prefer the active version-manager Node when installing daemons and include macOS version-manager bin directories in the service PATH so launchd services resolve user-managed runtimes.
- CLI/Status: fix `openclaw status --all` token summaries for bot-token-only channels so Mattermost/Zalo no longer show a bot+app warning. (#18527) Thanks @echo931.
- CLI/Configure: make the `/model picker` allowlist prompt searchable with tokenized matching in `openclaw configure` so users can filter huge model lists by typing terms like `gpt-5.2 openai/`. (#19010) Thanks @bjesuiter.
- CLI/Message: preserve `--components` JSON payloads in `openclaw message send` so Discord component payloads are no longer dropped. (#18222) Thanks @saurabhchopade.
- Voice Call: add an optional stale call reaper (`staleCallReaperSeconds`) to end stuck calls when enabled. (#18437)
- Auto-reply/Subagents: propagate group context (`groupId`, `groupChannel`, `space`) when spawning via `/subagents spawn`, matching tool-triggered subagent spawn behavior.
- Subagents: route nested announce results back to the parent session after the parent run ends, falling back only when the parent session is deleted. (#18043) Thanks @tyler6204.
- Subagents: cap announce retry loops with max attempts and expiry to prevent infinite retry spam after deferred announces. (#18444)
- Agents/Tools/exec: add a preflight guard that detects likely shell env var injection (e.g. `$DM_JSON`, `$TMPDIR`) in Python/Node scripts before execution, preventing recurring cron failures and wasted tokens when models emit mixed shell+language source. (#12836)
- Agents/Tools/exec: treat normal non-zero exit codes as completed and append the exit code to tool output to avoid false tool-failure warnings. (#18425)
- Agents/Tools: make loop detection progress-aware and phased by hard-blocking known `process(action=poll|log)` no-progress loops, warning on generic identical-call repeats, warning + no-progress-blocking ping-pong alternation loops (10/20), coalescing repeated warning spam into threshold buckets (including canonical ping-pong pairs), adding a global circuit breaker at 30 no-progress repeats, and emitting structured diagnostic `tool.loop` warning/error events for loop actions. (#16808) Thanks @akramcodez and @beca-oc.
- Agents/Hooks: preserve the `before_tool_call` wrapped-marker across abort-signal tool wrapping so the hook runs once per tool call in normal agent sessions. (#16852) Thanks @sreuter.
- Agents/Tests: add `before_message_write` persistence regression coverage for block/mutate behavior (including synthetic tool-result flushes) and thrown-hook fallback persistence. (#18197) Thanks @shakkernerd
- Agents/Tools: scope the `message` tool schema to the active channel so Telegram uses `buttons` and Discord uses `components`. (#18215) Thanks @obviyus.
- Agents/Image tool: replace Anthropic-incompatible union schema with explicit `image` (single) and `images` (multi) parameters, keeping tool schemas `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`-free while preserving multi-image analysis support. (#18551, #18566) Thanks @aldoeliacim.
- Agents/Models: probe the primary model when its auth-profile cooldown is near expiry (with per-provider throttling), so runs recover from temporary rate limits without staying on fallback models until restart. (#17478) Thanks @PlayerGhost.
- Agents/Failover: classify provider abort stop-reason errors (`Unhandled stop reason: abort`, `stop reason: abort`, `reason: abort`) as timeout-class failures so configured model fallback chains trigger instead of surfacing raw abort failures. (#18618) Thanks @sauerdaniel.
- Models/CLI: sync auth-profiles credentials into agent `auth.json` before registry availability checks so `openclaw models list --all` reports auth correctly for API-key/token providers, normalize provider-id aliases when bridging credentials, and skip expired token mirrors. (#18610, #18615)
- Agents/Context: raise default total bootstrap prompt cap from `24000` to `150000` chars (keeping `bootstrapMaxChars` at `20000`), include total-cap visibility in `/context`, and mark truncation from injected-vs-raw sizes so total-cap clipping is reflected accurately.
- Memory/QMD: scope managed collection names per agent and precreate glob-backed collection directories before registration, preventing cross-agent collection clobbering and startup ENOENT failures in fresh workspaces. (#17194) Thanks @jonathanadams96.
- Cron: preserve per-job schedule-error isolation in post-run maintenance recompute so malformed sibling jobs no longer abort persistence of successful runs. (#17852) Thanks @pierreeurope.
- Gateway/Config: prevent `config.patch` object-array merges from falling back to full-array replacement when some patch entries lack `id`, so partial `agents.list` updates no longer drop unrelated agents. (#17989) Thanks @stakeswky.
- Gateway/Auth: trim whitespace around trusted proxy entries before matching so configured proxies with stray spaces still authorize. (#18084) Thanks @Clawborn.
- Config/Discord: require string IDs in Discord allowlists, keep onboarding inputs string-only, and add doctor repair for numeric entries. (#18220) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Security/Sessions: create new session transcript JSONL files with user-only (`0o600`) permissions and extend `openclaw security audit --fix` to remediate existing transcript file permissions.
- Sessions/Maintenance: archive transcripts when pruning stale sessions, clean expired media in subdirectories, and purge `.deleted` transcript archives after the prune window to prevent disk leaks. (#18538)
- Infra/Fetch: ensure foreign abort-signal listener cleanup never masks original fetch successes/failures, while still preventing detached-finally unhandled rejection noise in `wrapFetchWithAbortSignal`. Thanks @Jackten.
- Heartbeat: allow suppressing tool error warning payloads during heartbeat runs via a new heartbeat config flag. (#18497) Thanks @thewilloftheshadow.
- Heartbeat: include sender metadata (From/To/Provider) in heartbeat prompts so model context matches the delivery target. (#18532) Thanks @dinakars777.
- Heartbeat/Telegram: strip configured `responsePrefix` before heartbeat ack detection (with boundary-safe matching) so prefixed `HEARTBEAT_OK` replies are correctly suppressed instead of leaking into DMs. (#18602)
