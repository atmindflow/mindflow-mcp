      This page is the dedicated release note landing page for OpenClaw v2026.2.19.
      It explicitly focuses on the latest release from https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
      and does not attempt to summarize earlier versions.

      Content overview:
      - A hero section summarizing the theme of the 2026.2.19 release
        (security hardening, smoother iOS and gateway behavior).
      - Filterable, searchable lists of "Changes" and "Fixes" derived directly
        from the official GitHub release notes body.
      - A dedicated section for npm post-release notes, clarifying which
        2026.2.19 builds were published under the beta dist-tag.
      - An interactive, GPU-accelerated 3D visualization that thematically
        represents the "security surface" for this release.

    <!-- Template, styles, and logic for the ReleaseNotes3D component.
         The component is responsible for rendering ONLY the latest
         2026.2.19 release information. If you need to update to a new
         release, replace the raw change/fix/post lists inside the
         component script below with the body of the new GitHub release. -->
